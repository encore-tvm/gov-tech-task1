Task 1
	A:  Error monitoring of apache log file
		Run the attached schell script with log file name as parameter
		eg. ./filecheck.sh apache_logs

	B. 	6 months logs can be keep On-premise and older than 3 months uptp 6 months log files can be compressed and keep in on-prem for faster retrieval
	    use tar and zip command to compress the logs
		for more than 6 months data can be stored in cloud ( AWS S3) 
		For the immediate solution compress some of the logs ( using tar and zip), so this can reduce the disk space for an interim solution
		

Task 2:

Jenkins is the best solution to implement the task 2, since i am not very familiar with jenkins , I am used AWS CodePipeline for the CI/CD pipeline to implement the node project.
